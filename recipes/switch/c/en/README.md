Specify variable which has integer on braces after switch, and specify integer, string, or const value. 
If you want to use another condition, use 'if' and 'else if'. 
Process stops at 'break'. If there is no 'break', process continues to next 'case'. 
If there is 'default' and the variable does not match any 'case', 'default ' is processed.
