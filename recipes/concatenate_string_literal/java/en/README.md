Concatenate string literals (string enclosed in double quotes).
To concatenate strings simply, use + operator. 
Since Java8, join method is added to String class, to concatenate strings with delimiter easily. 
However, if string is concatenated several times, + operator may affect performance. 
(Detailed explanation is not written here)
If string is concatenated several times, we should use StringBuilder.
